# Fall Detection

## Overview

This starter project allows you to build models to detect a fall using an IMU (Interial Mesurement Unit - accelerometer and gyroscope) mounted on the buckle of a belt.
For that, this starter project uses data collected from 2 different IMU: a Bosh IMU and an ST-Microelectronics IMU. Both IMU sensors are set up to collect data at 50 Hz using a +- 8g for the accelerometer scale and +- 500 dps for the gyro scale. 

This starter project gives you the infrastructure to allow you to expand on the project or to mimic it and create your own project based on the available/included tools. 
The starter project is intended to be a demonstration of how you could build a model using Imagimob AI for an IMU, accelerometer or gyroscope.

## Taking the Project Further

There are a number of ways to go forward once you have downloaded the project:

1. You can use this project as inspiration and collect your own data to build a project similar to it.

2. You can take the model, deploy it on a device and get a feeling for how this model would work in real-life. Make note though that this model was only trained on 6 individuals so it might need a bit more data to be able to generalise.
