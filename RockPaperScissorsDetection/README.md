# Rock Scissors Paper Detection Project

## Overview

The Rock, Scissors, Paper Detection Project is a real-time gesture recognition system powered by a YOLO-based backend for detecting and classifying hand gestures. The project focuses on building a robust end-to-end system that identifies rock, scissors, and paper gestures from live video input and determines outcomes based on the game's rules.

This project demonstrates the efficient integration of advanced object detection techniques with interactive applications, making it suitable for educational purposes, AI-powered games, and gesture-controlled systems.
