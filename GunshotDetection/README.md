# Gunshot Detection

## Overview

This is a starter model capable of detecting gunshots, quite far along in it's development before it was abandoned due to lack of testing capabilities. It includes strong invariance to many different background noises with around 2 hours of microphone data.
Due to issues with licenses, much of the gunshot data had to be excluded from this starter project.

## Collection of Data
The data was collected by downloading Creative Commons licensed audio files from freesounds.org. There was also a collection of gunshot data which could not be published here.

## Adding More Data
In order to add more data you need to upload 48000 Hz audio files with appropriate labels, which can be done directly in DEEPCRAFT Studio. 
The primary goal should be to add more gunshot audio files, since a number of them had to be removed.

## Steps to Production
The recommended path to production for this starter model is to identify the specific use case and tailor this starter model to that need, bolstering the dataset with more relevant data - both for gunshots and background noises.

## Potential Actions
possibly remove far away gunshots:
