# Indoor Detector

## Overview

The data consists of environmental sensor data recorded indoors and outdoors in different locations in Sweden during the course of two weeks. The data is collected at 3 Hz. 

The environmental sensor data collected is the following:

- Air pressure
- Air quality
- Humidity
- Temperature

This data was specifically collected using the Nordic Semiconductor Nordic Thingy:91. This project was created using a limited time period, the data needs to be expanded over multiple seasons for it to be able to generalise well to different climates. This is an example to get you started.

## Taking the Project Further

You can take the project further in a number of different ways:

1.	To create an accurate indoor/outdoor detector more data needs to be collected from different seasons and locations.

2.	Use the project as inspiration to build your own environmental sensor based project
